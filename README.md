## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this Project we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website, plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website 

The website consist of 7 pages total, and be deployed to GitHub pages.

### Data sources 
* [weather data](Resources/cities.csv) and pull the images from the [assets folder](Resources/assets).
### 
we use bootstrap and CSS to deploy
